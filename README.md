Yet another Android diary application

## Why?
Because I need to do something to educate myself. 
Also, I want to have a password-secured audio journal app with data encryption and synchronisation.

## How it's going?
Kinda slow

### Current tasks
Implemented:
* Password login
* Encrypted data storage (SQLCipher)
* CRUD for text records
* Nice tab interface

TODO:
* Usable audio recordings
* Logo & interface improvements

### What's next
* Photo attachments
* Location records
* Navigation by calendar
* Google Drive sync
* Other cloud storages sync
