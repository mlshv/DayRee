# DayRee
Yet another Android diary application

## Why?
Because I see a lot of diary apps at Google Play that have either good data protection or a lot of cool features. But not both

## How it's going?
Now I'm on the early stage of development

### MVP (minimum viable product)
Implemented:
* Secure login
* Encrypted data storage
* Nice tab interface

TODO:
* CRUD for text records
* Logo & interface improvements

### What's next
* Add threading to smooth UI
* Voice recordings
* Photo attachments
* Location records
* Navigation by calendar
* Google Drive sync
* Other cloud storages sync
